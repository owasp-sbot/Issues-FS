  "title": "Create shareable workflow document for agentic role-based development setup",
  "status": "done",
  "tags": ["librarian", "documentation", "workflow", "knowledge-request", "reusable"],
  "properties": {
    "assigned_to": "Librarian",
    "requested_by": "Human (Conductor)",
    "description": "Create a single, self-contained document that explains the current agentic development workflow used in the Issues-FS ecosystem. This document will be used as a template/guide for setting up similar agentic workflows on OTHER projects. It must be written to be project-agnostic and NOT dependent on a multi-repo architecture.",
    "requirements": [
      "MUST be a single document (not spread across multiple files)",
      "MUST be project-agnostic — explain the pattern, not Issues-FS specifics",
      "MUST NOT assume multi-repo / submodule architecture — the target project is smaller and uses a single repo",
      "MUST be usable as a starting point for a new project with a similar agentic setup"
    ],
    "content_to_cover": [
      "The role-based agent coordination model (Conductor, Architect, Dev, QA, DevOps, Librarian + extensible)",
      "How ROLE.md files work as both human documentation AND agent briefing",
      "The hub-and-spoke subagent pattern (parent Conductor spawns role-specific agents)",
      "How Issues-FS (or any file-based issue tracker) serves as the coordination bus between agents",
      "The typed issue state machine (Task, Handoff, Decision, Defect, Approval, Knowledge_Request, etc.)",
      "How agents communicate via issues and file artifacts (not direct messaging)",
      "The review workflow: Architect plans -> Dev executes -> QA reviews -> Conductor approves",
      "How LLM guidance docs (briefs, coding standards) ground agent behaviour",
      "The task lifecycle: todo -> in-progress -> done, with dev_notes and comments",
      "Code comment traceability (referencing issue labels in code)",
      "How to adapt this to a single-repo project (roles/ as folders, not separate repos)",
      "Lessons learned: what worked, what didn't, what to watch for (e.g. type safety regressions, agent context limits, background agent timeouts)"

      "roles/Issues-FS__Dev__Role__Architect/docs/plan__phase-2-refactoring.md (example of Architect output)",

    ],
    "notes": "This is high priority — the project owner needs this for a new project they are starting. The document should be practical and actionable, not theoretical. Think of it as a 'getting started guide for agentic development' that someone could follow to set up their own role-based AI agent team on any project."
