    "description": "When developers add code comments referencing work done (e.g. '# Phase 2 Changes: B10: nodes_list_all() for recursive discovery'), these comments should include the Issues-FS Issue-Id and Label (e.g. Task-1) so that the graph can connect code changes to the issues that drove them. Currently the Dev agent wrote comments like '# B10: nodes_list_all()...' but did NOT include 'Task-1' or the node_id. This breaks the traceability chain from code -> issue -> brief -> decision.",

      "Document the exact format for code comments that reference issues (e.g. '# [Task-1/B10] nodes_list_all() for recursive discovery')",
      "Define whether to use label (Task-1), node_id (a1b2c3d0), or both",
      "Define format for multi-issue references (when one code change addresses multiple tasks)",
      "Create a convention document at modules/Issues-FS__Docs/docs/development/convention__code-comment-traceability.md",
      "Include examples of good and bad comments",
      "Define how these comments should be parseable (so a future tool can extract issue references from code)",
      "Update the Dev ROLE.md 'Coding Standards' section to include this convention",
      "Consider: should this also apply to commit messages? (e.g. 'feat(Task-1/B10): add recursive node discovery')"

    "notes": "This is a graph connectivity issue at its core. Code comments are nodes. Issues are nodes. Without explicit references, we lose the edge between them. The Librarian should think about this as a cataloguing problem: how do we ensure every code change is catalogued back to the issue that requested it?"
