    "description": "Rewrite label_from_type_and_index() to produce hyphenated labels (user-story --> User-Story-5). Add type_to_label_prefix() helper. Add parse_label_to_type() for reverse operation matching against known types (longest first). Update resolve_link_target() (renamed from _resolve_link_target) to use parse_label_to_type(). Rename _traverse_graph to traverse_graph and _find_incoming_links to find_incoming_links (remove underscore prefix per coding patterns).",
    "dev_notes": "Implemented label_from_type_and_index with hyphen-aware formatting, type_to_label_prefix helper, parse_label_to_type with longest-first matching against known types, and updated resolve_link_target to use parse_label_to_type. Updated Safe_Str__Node_Label regex to support multi-word labels (Git-Repo-1, User-Story-5). The _traverse_graph, _resolve_link_target, _find_incoming_links methods were already renamed in prior B10-B13 work. 16 new tests in test_Node__Service__B22__Hyphenated_Labels.py. All 387 tests pass."
