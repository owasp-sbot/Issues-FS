    "description": "Graph__Repository.get_issue_file_path() at line 131 has return type -> str when it should be -> Safe_Str__File__Path. This method is the central path-resolution function called by node_load, node_exists, and other critical paths. During the B13 refactoring, the Dev modified this method's body (removed node.json fallback, added explicit is True check) and updated its comments, but did not fix the raw str return type. Since Safe_Str__File__Path is already imported in this file (line 22), this should have been corrected as part of the B13 changes.",
